# House Price Prediction Using Regression

A regression-based project that predicts house prices from structured housing data using statistical and machine learning regression techniques.

---

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a house price prediction system, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
The project focuses on building a clean and reproducible regression pipeline aligned with industry GitHub standards.

---

## Problem Statement

Given structured housing features, predict the corresponding house price as a continuous numerical value.

---

## Solution Approach

- Load and explore the housing dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Train a regression model on training data  
- Evaluate model performance on unseen test data  

---

## Model Details

- **Problem Type:** Supervised Regression  
- **Model:** Regression-based estimator  
- **Target Variable:** House price (continuous)  
- **Evaluation:** Regression performance metrics  

This model serves as a baseline solution and can be extended with more advanced regression techniques.

## Technology Stack

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow

---

## Dataset

- **Type:** Structured tabular housing data and dataset from Scikit-learn
- **Features:** Numerical attributes related to housing characteristics  
- **Target:** House price  

---

## Results

The regression model is able to learn relationships between input features and house prices and provides reasonable predictive performance on test data.

### Model Performance
Regression evaluation metrics are used to assess prediction accuracy.
